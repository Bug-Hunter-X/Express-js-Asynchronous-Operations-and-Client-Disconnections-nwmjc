# Express.js Asynchronous Operations and Client Disconnections

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications involving asynchronous operations and the handling of client disconnections before the response is sent.  The bug showcases a scenario where a delayed response might not reach the client if the client closes the connection prematurely. The solution provides a robust way to handle such situations, preventing unexpected errors and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Bug Description
The main issue lies in the asynchronous nature of the `setTimeout` function in the provided Express.js code. The server simulates a 5-second delay before sending the response. If the client closes the connection within this delay, the server will continue processing, but the response will be discarded because there is no active connection to send it to. This might not immediately lead to an obvious error but could cause unexpected behavior for the client application.

## Solution
The solution introduces proper error handling using event listeners for the connection's `close` event.  This allows the server to gracefully handle client disconnections without throwing errors and preventing unnecessary server crashes.
